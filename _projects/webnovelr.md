The webnovel ecosystem is comprised of various writers and readers. However, despite the ecosystem being a media where many people come and go, the truth is that there are many visual aspects lacking considerations of the participants. Webnovelr is a project that attempts to better the ecosystem of webnovels.

Webnovels are usually served by only a few platforms in Korea. The representative platforms are Kakao Page and Munpia. Webnovel writers send their literature to these platforms. Each platform have different layouts, thus showing the same literature in a different way. Writers name these differences as ‘Jopan’, which is known to affect how readers read the literature.

To writers, ‘the reader’s speed of reading’ is as important as the originality of the webnovel. If a tense scene does not fit in one page but continues on to the next page, there is a possibility where readers can feel bored of the webnovel. Despite these concerns, there exists no editor that allows webnovel writers to keep track of the reader’s speed of writing. To make the writing experience easier for webnovel writers, Webnovelr presents a ‘Jopan’ based editor.
