Docker basic usage

if you changed something in docker do

```
docker-compose down
```

if you want to start docker just do

```
docker-compose up
```

Or if you do not want to show the terminal just do

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## If Dockerfile is changed

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Next opensource idea

I want to continue with dotting. This time I want to use canvas to create a 2d pixel editor. Plus, I have always thought about creating a multiplayer game using websocket. I will try to use the game as an advertisement for the opensource dotting project.
