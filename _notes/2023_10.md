I pondered about what I realy aspire to do.

I have a penchant to creating products that have a didactic manner.

I want to teach the core values of humanness through my creation.

Thus whenever I feel that my creation seems to mature and befit the needs of an expert rather than a novice, it is then do I feel bored about the project.

I do not intend to fit my services to an esoteric group but rather a larger audience especially those who can hope for their betterment.
