Found something crazy: https://copy.sh/v86/?profile=windows98

This was built using javascript and wasm

I found this website by reading https://www.quadratichq.com/blog/2022-11-15-next-gen-web-applications

It seems that in the near future, all web developers should know some WASM.

Seems like there is a need to study Rust somehow in the future.

Maybe I will try building something with rust and javascript later on

Where should I start? Creating a 3D game?
