\begin
x &amp;= 5\cos(t) <!-- -->\<!-- -->
y &amp;= 5\sin(t) <!-- -->\<!-- -->
z &amp;= 25\cos(t) \sin(t)
\end
$$ </p><p>This is a parametric curve that represents the intersection of the two equations. The approach we used was to use a common variable $t$ to represent the equations. This is a very powerful concept that can be used to represent complex equations in a single vector form.</p><div style="width:100%;height:300px;position:relative;outline:none" tabindex="1"><canvas id="dotting-background-canvas" style="position:absolute;border:1px solid #555555;pointer-events:none;background-color:#999999"></canvas><canvas id="dotting-data-canvas" style="position:absolute;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid #555555"></canvas><canvas id="dotting-interaction-canvas" style="position:absolute;border:1px solid #555555"></canvas><canvas id="dotting-grid-canvas" style="position:absolute;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid #555555"></canvas><canvas id="dotting-foreground-canvas" style="position:absolute;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid #555555"></canvas></div></div></div><div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-16 mb-16"><div class="flex justify-between w-full mb-20 flex-wrap"><a href="/posts/linear_regression_geometry" class="bg-white rounded-lg md:hover:scale-[1.01] transition hover:shadow-lg duration-200 cursor-pointer drop-shadow-md p-3 mb-3"><div>Previous</div><div class="text-sm font-bold text-left">← <!-- -->Linear Regression Model Selection (feat.
