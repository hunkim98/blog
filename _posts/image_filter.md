## What is filtering?

Filtering is a technique that is used to enhance or remove certain features in a target signal. This technique can be helpful especially when the target signal is noisy or when the target signal has unwanted features. Filtering can be applied to various types of signals, such as audio signals, image signals, and video signals. In this post, we will focus on image filtering.

The two most common types of image filters are spatial filters and frequency filters. Spatial filters are filters that operate directly on the pixel values of an image. They are simple to implement and are widely used in image processing. Frequency filters, on the other hand, operate on the frequency domain of an image. They are more complex to implement but can be more powerful in certain applications.
