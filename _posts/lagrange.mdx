## Lagrange is for optimization

When we discuss about optimization, we often times have a function that explains the relationship of our variables and our output with an additional budget constraint. Optimization is about maximizing or minimizing the output given the constraints. This constraint allows us to think about optimization. For example, think of a simple optimization problem where you want to maximize the output of revenue given the constraint of budget. Let us say you have a function $f(x,y)$ where x is the quantity you can produce
